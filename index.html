        <h3>Drink Mixing Machine (Beverage Mixing Machine)</h3>
        <p>Control End Development (PCB + Python + C/C++) (2023.10 - 2024.02)</p>
        <p>Project Introduction: The client GUI displays the list of available beverages. After selecting a beverage, the client retrieves the flow rate of the dispenser from the configuration file and calculates the time required to dispense the beverage and the discharge count required to fill the cup. The time information will be sent to the PCB controller to which the corresponding dispenser belongs. The dispenser will control the opening time to allow the beverage to flow out according to the time information.</p>
        <p>Project Responsibilities: Optimize the serial communication time at the control end, measure the torque of the dispenser motor more frequently to achieve more precise dispenser control; on this basis, optimize the polling logic of the control end dispenser to make the dispenser work precisely according to the time parameters.</p>
